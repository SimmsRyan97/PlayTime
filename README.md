# PlayTime
PlayTime is designed for Minecraft servers that allows users to track their play time on the server easily. Not only can players check their own play time, but they can also view the play time of other users.

## Features
### User Playtime Tracking:
- Each player’s total playtime is recorded and stored.
- Players can check their individual playtime statistics at any time, providing insight into their engagement with the server.
### Leaderboard of Top Players:
- A list of the top players based on their playtime is generated and updated automatically.
- The leaderboard includes pagination, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate, especially for large communities.
### Customizable Commands:
- The plugin includes commands that can be configured in the config.yml file, allowing server owners to enable or disable certain features or change permission nodes.
- Commands are protected with permission checks to ensure that only authorized players can access the leaderboard.
### User-Friendly Messaging:
- Messages are displayed in chat with color coding, using Minecraft's built-in chat colors for enhanced readability and engagement.
- Feedback is provided for invalid inputs, ensuring players receive immediate and clear responses when they interact with the plugin.
### Configurable Settings:
- Server owners can adjust settings such as command permissions, pagination size, and display formats directly within the plugin's configuration file.
- This flexibility allows for a tailored experience that fits the needs of different server environments.
### Translated Messages:
- Automatic language translation based on user's language setting.
- Set console language in config file.
